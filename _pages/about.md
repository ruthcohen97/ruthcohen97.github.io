I am a rising 3rd year Economics and Finance PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying household finance and public economics. 

I am interested in questions concerning consumer access to credit, the effects of that access on financial wellbeing, and the role of government policy in shaping these outcomes.

Prior to my studies at Wisconsin, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
